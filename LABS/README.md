### Language and Style
Reports should be written in the third person and past tense, maintaining clarity and professionalism. Use continuous prose, avoiding reliance on figures or equations to replace proper sentences and paragraphs.

### Laboratory Report Checklist
This checklist ensures all necessary elements are included in the report, from the objective to references. Adherence to the checklist directly influences grading, alongside technical correctness and clarity.

### Grading
Reports are graded on technical content and writing quality. Collaboration is allowed for data collection, but the report preparation and analysis must be an individual effort.

### Outline of ECE Laboratory Report
The report structure includes a title page, introduction, theory, experimental procedure, results, interpretation, conclusions, references, and an appendix (if necessary). Each section serves a specific purpose to ensure the report is complete and organized.

### Report Writing Checklist
Ensure that the experiment’s objective, purpose, limitations, theory, procedure, and results are clearly documented. The report should also include proper references and an appendix if needed.

   - **Purpose**
     - What is the purpose of this experiment?
   - **Scope**
     - What are the limitations of this experiment?

3. **Theory**
   - What is the theoretical basis of this experiment? [Brief statement]
   - What preliminary work was required before the lab session itself?

4. **Experimental Procedure**
   - **Schematic**
     - Neatly drawn schematic, block diagram, etc. of the circuits used in the experiment. Include the test equipment.
   - **Procedure**
     - Outline the methods used in the experiment.
   - **All Apparatus**

     - Model number
     - Serial number
   - **Results**
     - Original data sheet from the experiment.
     - Include date, experiment number, and signatures of the students running the experiment.
     - Graphs
     - Sample calculations

5. **Interpretation**
   - Compare your results with the expected results.
   - Discuss possible sources of error.

6. **Conclusions**
   - What can you conclude from the results?

7. **References**

8. **Appendix** [If necessary]

##  ECE Laboratory Report Checklist

- The objective of the experiment is clearly described.
- The purpose and limitations of the experiment are clearly defined.
- Necessary theory has been included. Pre-lab work is included.
- The experimental procedure that was used to collect the data is clearly described.
- The apparatus that was used to collect the data is clearly described.
- The discussion of data refers clearly to the tables, charts, graphs, etc., but deals with the concepts rather than simply repeating the data.
- Tables, charts, graphs, etc. are organized logically and labeled clearly.
- The test results are clearly indicated. (The original data sheet is included.)
- The test results are correctly interpreted.
- Proper conclusions have been made from the interpretations.
- Lab report pages are numbered, and the document is stapled.
